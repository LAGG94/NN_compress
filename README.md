# Neural Network Compression and Acceleration Methods

I am currently doing a survey of the different neural network 
compression and acceleration methods. In this survey, I will choose some 
of the most representative techniques of the different methods that can 
be implemented with the available frameworks.

This repo currently contains a PyTorch implementation of the popular 
VGG16 network, which will serve as a base for the network comparisons 
with the selected methods. The methods chosen will be added to this 
repo.
